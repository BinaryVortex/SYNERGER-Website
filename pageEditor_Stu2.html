    <h3>Main (Home) Page</h3>
    <p>
        Design and Layout: Finished designing the home page layout, making sure it has all the necessary components,<br> including links to content pages, the website mission, the navigation bar, and the website identity (logo).<br><br>

        Logo and Mission: Made sure the website's logo was shown prominently on the front page, <br>and that the UN Sustainable Development Goal that best suited the goal of our website was explained.<br><br>
        
        
        navigating Bar: To provide smooth navigating to different website areas,<br> a CSS-based navigation bar with hover effects and active page indicator was developed.<br><br>
        
        Links to Content Pages: Included links to the website's four content pages so that visitors may easily access them and continue exploring.<br><br>
    
        Adherence to standards and norms was ensured by making sure that the Janet requirements for web page publishing were followed.<br><br>

    <h3>Feedback Page:</h3>
    <p> 
        Improved Functionality: The Feedback Page now has more features and JavaScript functions, such as form validation,<br> error handling, preview and edit options, and confirmation messages. <br><br>
        Additional Features: To enhance the user experience,<br> it was thought to include dynamic form components, graphic improvements, and auto-fill features.<br><br>

        Integration: To preserve a consistent look,<br> JavaScript improvements were seamlessly included with the Feedback Page's current CSS and HTML code.<br><br>
        
        Testing and Optimization: Prior to launch,<br> the Feedback Page was extensively tested and optimized for seamless operation across a variety of browsers and devices.<br><br>

    <h3>Content Page</h3>
    <p> 
        To keep the user experience constant, the navigation bar template has to be applied to every content page. This choice was well-informed by extensive study on biomass energy,<br> guaranteeing compatibility with the website's subject. <br> Through the thoughtful use of navigation components, my goal was to provide easy access to relevant data.<br> I refined the implementation iteratively in order to improve user engagement and make navigation simple.
